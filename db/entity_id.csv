Fleming is a direct descendant (4th great grandson) to Lt. Abia Clay (1747–1791), a regular in the American Continental Army and ninth great grandson to John Clay born 1587 in Wales who immigrated to America and settled in the original Jamestowne, VA settlement. A soldier in the British Army, John gained the rank of Captain by the age of 21 and was sent to Virginia to control problems that were developing. John Clay was placed in charge of the fifty Muskateers aboard Captain Samuel Argall's ship, the Treasurer, which was sent to protect the settlers at Jamestown. John Clay eventually became sympathetic to the cause of the settlers and resigned his military post. All three ancestral ties are derived through Fleming's maternal grandmother, Mary Pauline CLAY Giles. On May 15, 2010, Fleming was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution.</p>",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/John_Fleming.jpg/225px-John_Fleming.jpg,2015-01-06,2017-01-03
